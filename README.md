# Enigma-Machine-Project
A simple List &amp; Dictionary based simulation of the Nazi Enigma Machine used to encrypt messages during World War 2.
The first program has been implemented in Python for my Grade 12 CBSE Project.
I wrote it when I didn't know OOP, hence this is a non-Object Oriented Implementation.
It acts as an introduction to the logic behind Caeser Cipher based cryptography for budding programmers with little experince in computer languages.
